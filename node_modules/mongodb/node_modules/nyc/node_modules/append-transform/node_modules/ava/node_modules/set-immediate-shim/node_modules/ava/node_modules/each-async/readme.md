> Async concurrent iterator (async forEach)

Like [async.each()](https://github.com/caolan/async#eacharr-iterator-callback), but tiny.

I often use `async.each()` for doing async operations when iterating, but I almost never use the other gadzillion methods in `async`.

Async iteration is one of the most used async control flow patterns.
