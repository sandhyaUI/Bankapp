# sf-lint
Lint configuration at Simplifield.

To use those rules in your projects, first, install it
 as a development dependency and than add a `lintconfig`
 script containing the following command:
```sh
sf-lint-config
```

It will automatically append the SimpliField rules to your
project.

Theses are our own rules but you can require a reconsideration
 of a rule by creating an issue which name is the rule you
 wanna change.
